## P04- Processing in Trie Tree Time
### Adesan Olamide
### Description:
To generate a dictionary, this software uses a Trie data structure. 
          It will read the dictionary terms from a file. The application 
        will calculate the time it takes to discover the words and display 
          the top ten results, as well as using getching to hold keyboard input.
